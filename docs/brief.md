# Bloom Scroll: Product Brief

## Vision
Counter "doom scrolling" by creating a mobile-first content aggregator that optimizes for **enrichment** and **serendipity** instead of engagement and outrage.

## Core Concept
A "Perspective Engine" that synthesizes:
- Raw statistical truth (Our World in Data)
- Frontier science (OpenAlex)
- Decentralized creativity (Neocities)
- Aesthetic novelty (CARI Institute, Aesthetics Wiki)
- Educational opportunities (My-MOOC)

Into a finite, high-value daily digest that leaves users feeling more informed and optimistic.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. The "Slow Web" Framework
- **Finite Feeds**: Definitive "End" state after ~20 cards
- **Upward Scrolling**: Users "plant" ideas and scroll "up" to see them bloom
- **Raw over Cooked**: Render data from source (CSV/JSON) vs static images
- **Serendipity over Similarity**: Penalize repetitiveness, prioritize outliers

### 2. Perspective Layer
- **Bias Classification**: Detect 18 types of bias including sensationalism
- **Blindspot Detection**: Identify under-covered perspectives
- **Factfulness Check**: Cross-reference claims against statistical datasets

### 3. Content Diversity
Blend six content types into unified "BloomCard" format:
- Macro-Data (OWID charts)
- Science (OpenAlex papers)
- Aesthetic (Visual culture)
- Indie Web (Neocities sites)
- Narrative (TVTropes analysis)
- Education (Free courses)

## Success Metrics
1. Users complete the feed (vs infinite scrolling)
2. Post-session sentiment is positive
3. Content diversity remains high (low clustering)
4. Time-on-site is bounded and intentional

## Target Audience
Information-conscious individuals suffering from news fatigue who want:
- Balanced perspective without echo chambers
- Progress-oriented content
- Aesthetic and intellectual enrichment
- Finite, guilt-free consumption
